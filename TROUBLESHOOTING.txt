ERROR: Python module PyQt6 is not installed.
--------------------------------------------
This application makes use of the Python3 module PyQt6.

HOW TO INSTALL IT (LINUX):

You should first check if python3-pyqt6 package exists in your linux
distribution repositories and install it from there, such as:

apt install python3-pyqt6
(for Debian/Ubuntu/Lubuntu users)

for a system-wide availability. However as of today (2024-02-11) this
package is not yet available in the Debian repositories for 22.04 LTS
and I heard word it would be available probably in April 2024.

Another way is to install it only as a python module for the current
project:

python -m pip venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

And finally you can run the application.
