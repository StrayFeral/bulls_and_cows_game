# bulls_and_cows_game
Command-line and PyQt implementation of the classic "Bulls and Cows" game.

## bulls_and_cows_game.py
Command-line version. Completely standalone script.

Taken directly as is from my python_exercises repository, but I still 
left it there too to keep the commit history. 

This version passed black, mypy and flake8.

## bulls_and_cows_game_qt.py
GUI PyQt version.

Requires PyQt6.
This version was creating using the Qt Designer 6.4.3.

For this reason, this version got no black, mypy nor flake8, as 
in general the PyQt convention totally breaks the general Python 
styleguide conventions.
